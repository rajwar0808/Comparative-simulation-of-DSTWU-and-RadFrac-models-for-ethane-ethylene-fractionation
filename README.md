# Comparative-simulation-of-DSTWU-and-RadFrac-models-for-ethane-ethylene-fractionation
Simulation study of ethane–ethylene separation using DSTWU and RadFrac distillation column models at 15 psia with the RK-Soave property method. Includes calculation of minimum/actual reflux ratio, number of stages, feed location, and product compositions.

1 DSTWU Model

Problem Statement

A feed stream, consisting of 60 mole% ethane and 40 mole% ethylene, enters a DSTWU column having a flow rate of 200 lbmol/hr at 75°F and 15 psia. This feed is required to fractionate in a distillation column capable of recovering at least 99.6% of the light key component in the distillate and 99.9% of the heavy key component in the bottoms. The sample process operates at 15 psia with zero tray-to-tray pressure drop. The pressure in the reboiler as well as condenser is also 15 psia. In the simulation, use total 30 theoretical stages (including a total condenser and reboiler). Applying the RK-Soave property method, simulate the column and calculate the minimum reflux ratio, actual reflux ratio, minimum number of stages, actual number of stages, and feed location.

2 RadFrac Model

Problem Statement

We will continue the above problem with few modifications. A hydrocarbon stream, consisting of 60 mole% ethane and 40 mole% ethylene, enters a RadFrac column having a flow rate of 200 Ibmol/hr at 75°F and 15 psia. The distillation process that has total 30 theoretical stages (including a total condenser and reboiler) operates at 15 psia with zero pressure drop throughout. The distillate rate, reflux ratio and feed tray location are obtained previously. Consider the same RK-Soave property method.

(a) Simulate the column and compute the compositions of top as well as bottom products.

(b) Is there any discrepancy in product compositions obtained from RadFrac and DSTWU columns? If yes, what is the main reason?
